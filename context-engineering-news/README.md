# Context Engineering Daily News

🤖 An automated system that generates daily news digest about Context Engineering developments in AI and LLM research.

## What is Context Engineering?

Context Engineering is a rapidly evolving field in AI that focuses on optimizing how we structure, present, and manage contextual information for AI systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). This includes:

- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting effective prompts for better AI responses
- **In-Context Learning**: Teaching AI through examples within the context
- **Chain-of-Thought**: Structured reasoning approaches
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combining retrieval with generation
- **Context Window Management**: Efficient use of limited context space
- **Multi-modal Context**: Handling text, image, audio contexts together
